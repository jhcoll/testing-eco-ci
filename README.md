## An example of a CI pipeline that estimates energy consumption
This branch contains an example of a CI pipeline that estimates the energy consumption of a build. The pipeline is based on the [ECO CI Energy Estimation Action](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/eco-ci-energy-estimation)

The above is an example of a badge that shows the energy consumption of the [last build](https://github.com/jhcoll/testing-eco-ci/actions/runs/7116454849) on the energy-estimation branch.
